## Coding style

* Only one class, interface per file
* Name of the file must be the same as name of the class, interface
* Folders on the file system must follow the namespaces we created
* Classes and interfaces should use the following naming convention "ExampleClass"
* Names of variables, functions, methods should use the following naming convention: "variable_name" - this should apply to all elments without any exception
* Constants (either declared with "const" or "define") should be capitalized
* There should be ONE empty line between opening php tag and namespace declaration
* There should be TWO empty lines between last namespace declaration/use and first line of class declaration
* There should be ONE empty line between namespace declaration and first use statment
* First we list all "use" statments that refer to external dependencies and then all that refer to internal dependencies
* Use tabs for indention
